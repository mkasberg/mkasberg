## Hi, I'm Mike 👋

I work for [Strava](https://github.com/strava) as a senior software engineer.

Here are some of my most interesting open source projects on GitHub:

- 🛠️ My [dotfiles](https://github.com/mkasberg/dotfiles) are public and I've put
  a lot of effort into making them work well for me. Maybe there are some tricks
  in there that would work well for you too!
- 🌱 [Script Seed](https://github.com/mkasberg/script-seed/) is a small project
  I maintain that provides boilerplate in many different scripting languages.
- 🐳 [Container Immersion](https://github.com/mkasberg/container-immersion) is a
  Docker tutorial I maintain.
- I've made minor contributions to some popular open source projects including
  [phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) and
  [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

📝 I write a blog at <https://www.mikekasberg.com>.
