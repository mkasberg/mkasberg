## Hi, I'm Mike 👋

I work for [Strava](https://github.com/strava) as a senior software engineer.

Here are some of my most interesting open source projects on GitHub:

- 🛠️ My [dotfiles](https://github.com/mkasberg/dotfiles) are public and I've put
  a lot of effort into making them work well for me. Maybe there are some tricks
  in there that would work well for you too!
- 🌱 [Script Seed](https://github.com/mkasberg/script-seed/) is a small project
  I maintain that provides boilerplate in many different scripting languages.
- 🐳 [Container Immersion](https://github.com/mkasberg/container-immersion) is a
  Docker tutorial I maintain.
- :octocat: I've made minor contributions to some popular open source projects including
  [jekyll/classifier-reborn](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amkasberg+is%3Amerged),
  [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amkasberg+is%3Amerged),
  [rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amkasberg+is%3Amerged)
  and [phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amkasberg+is%3Amerged).
- 🏗️ I've recently gotten into 3D printing, and I share some of my
  [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) creations here on GitHub. Check out my [3D
  Logo](https://github.com/mkasberg/3d-logo) and [3D Photo
  Frame](https://github.com/mkasberg/3d-photo-frame).
